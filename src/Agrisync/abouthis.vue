            For over 23 years the newly designated Director IV has been giving her commitment and dedication to serving the agriculture sector. 
             <br>
             <br>
            She started her career at the Department of Agriculture in 1999 as a contractual Research Assistant at the Region IV Southern Tagalog Integrated Agricultural
             Research Center under the Comprehensive Irrigation Development Umbrella Program, a special project of Department of Agriculture and 
             University of the Philippines-Los Baños. After four years, she became a permanent employee as an Agriculture Technologist I at the Department of Agriculture MIMAROPA. 
             Her career forwarded as Engineer I for six years, and was designated as the Corn Program Regional Focal Person in 2015.

             <br>
             Under her leadership as a regional focal person, the provinces of MIMAROPA yearly received several recognitions at the National Corn Quality Achievers Award for consistently
              surpassing the production targets and having outstanding agriculture extension workers because of her outpouring support for the local technicians.

              Being a mother of four and a civil servant, Director Inting proved to be a woman of will and determination. She also strived to finish her Master’s Degree in Public Management major in Rural 
              Development in just a year (2017-2018) under a scholarship granted by the Agricultural Training Institute and Development Academy of the Philippines. 

              With all her accomplishments, credentials, and qualities, she was promoted to Engineer V and became the Chief of the Regional Agriculture Engineering Division in 2019.

              Having proven that she could take on the challenges and responsibilities of a director; she was then entrusted to become an OIC-Regional Executive Director of DA-MIMAROPA in 2022. After a year 
              and several deliberations with the heads of the agency, she was designated by President and the current DA Secretary, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr., as the youngest Director IV and now a full-fledged Regional Executive Director at the age of 49.
